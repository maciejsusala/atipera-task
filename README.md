# Notes
This application uses the GitHub API v3 as the backing API.

# Feign for JSON Processing
This application uses Feign as a declarative web service client to interact with the GitHub API. 
Feign simplifies the process of making HTTP requests and handling JSON responses by providing a clean and easy-to-use interface.
It automatically converts JSON responses into Java objects, making it easier to work with the data returned from the GitHub API.

# Usage of DTOs
DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) are used to encapsulate data and transfer it between different layers of the application.

# Testing
This application includes unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the code. The following testing frameworks and tools are used:  
JUnit: For writing and running unit tests.
Mockito: For mocking dependencies in unit tests.

Running Tests:
To run the tests, use the following Maven command:
mvn: test
